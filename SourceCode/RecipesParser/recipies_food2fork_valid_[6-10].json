         "content":"Preheat oven to 400 degrees. In a medium bowl, whisk together chili powder, garlic powder, onion powder, cumin, salt, lime juice, olive oil, and water. Stir in chickpeas and cauliflower florets. Place seasoned chickpeas and cauliflower on a greased baking sheet. Roast for 30-35 minutes, stirring occasionally during cooking, until chickpeas are slightly crispy and cauliflower is tender. Remove from oven and set aside. To make the lime crema, place the Greek yogurt or sour cream in a small bowl. Add fresh lime juice and cilantro. Stir well. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Take a corn tortilla and place roasted cauliflower and chickpeas on top. Top with red cabbage, jalape\u00c3\u00b1o slices, avocado, and cilantro. Drizzle lime crema over the tacos and serve! Note-you can make the tacos vegan by using vegan sour cream or yogurt to make the lime crema or you can omit it\u2026but it\u2019s really good:)",
